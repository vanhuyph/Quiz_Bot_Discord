# Discord QuizoBot :robot:
QuizoBot is a Discord bot bringing to your server a fun multiplayer quiz game. You have the option of playing by yourself but you can also play with the other members of your Discord server and grind the ranks thanks to the leaderboard implemented by the bot.

With the help of [OpenTDB](https://opentdb.com/), QuizoBot provides you over 4,000 questions and 24 different categories for endless games.

The project is based on an event-driven architecture.

## How to install :computer:
**Creating a Discord bot account**
1. Log your Discord account on the [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and click on the "New Application" button.
2. Provide a name to your bot and click on the "Create" button.
3. On the left sidebar, click on "Bot" and then click on the "Add Bot" button on the right.
4. Now, you'll need your bot's password. Under "Token", press on the "Reset Token" button, copy your token and then keep it somewhere safe. Don't worry, if you lose your bot's token you'll still have the ability to reset your token again which will invalidate the previous one.
5. On the same page, under the "Privileged Gateway Intents" section, enable the "MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT" option. It'll be needed when running the bot.
6. Grab the link below and paste it into your browser while replacing "YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE" with yours. Your client ID is available in the sidebar OAuth2 -> General -> Client information. Finally, select the server where you want your bot to appear.

```sh
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE&permissions=0&scope=bot%20applications.commands
```
**Setting up the bot and installation**
1. Make sure to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 16.9.0 or newer. You can check your node's version in a prompt with 
```sh
node -v
```
2. Clone this repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/vanhuyph/QuizoBot_Discord.git
```
3. Replace the values in the `.env.example` file with your bot's token and client ID from earlier and remove the `.example`
```sh
TOKEN='YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE'
CLIENT_ID='YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE'
```
4. Install the dependencies
```sh
npm install
```
5. Initialize the local DB
```sh
npm run dbInit
```
6. Lastly, start the app
```sh
npm start
```
> **Note:**
> In case you want to reset the local DB use `npm run forceInitdb`.
